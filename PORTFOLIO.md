A modern, professional portfolio website for Steven Hagene, a Senior Software Developer and former Marine, built with Next.js. The design should feature the following elements:

Homepage:

A hero section with a dynamic, animated background that subtly incorporates binary code or circuit patterns in USMC colors: Scarlet (#CC0000) and Gold (#FFC300).
A brief, impactful introduction highlighting Steven's expertise in full-stack development, UX engineering, and military background.
An interactive timeline of Steven's professional journey, from his Marine Corps service to his current role.


Skills and Technologies:

A dynamic, filterable grid showcasing Steven's technical skills (e.g., React, Angular, Flutter, JavaScript, TypeScript).
Each skill should be represented by an icon or logo, with a hover effect revealing more details.


Projects Showcase:

A gallery of Steven's key projects, featuring screenshots or mockups.
Each project card should have a flip animation, revealing project details and technologies used on the back.
Implement a filter system to sort projects by technology or industry.


Experience Section:

An interactive timeline or accordion-style layout detailing Steven's work history.
For each role, include expandable sections with key achievements and responsibilities.


Design System Showcase:

A dedicated section highlighting Steven's expertise in design systems.
Include interactive examples of components he's created, demonstrating their versatility.


Blog or Insights:

A dynamically updated blog section where Steven can share his thoughts on technology trends, development best practices, or lessons from his military experience.


Contact Form:

An aesthetically pleasing, functional contact form with client-side validation.
Include social media links and a downloadable resume option.


Responsive Design:

Ensure the entire site is fully responsive and optimized for various devices and screen sizes.


Performance Optimization:

Implement Next.js best practices for optimal loading speeds and performance.
Use Next.js Image component for optimized image loading.


Accessibility:

Ensure the site meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards for accessibility.


Dark Mode Toggle:

Implement a sleek dark mode option, using a color scheme that complements the USMC colors.


Easter Egg:

Include a hidden feature or animation that showcases Steven's creativity and attention to detail, possibly tied to his Marine Corps background.



The overall style should be professional yet innovative, reflecting Steven's blend of technical expertise and military discipline. Use a clean, modern typeface and incorporate subtle animations to enhance user engagement without overwhelming the content. The color scheme should primarily use navy blue (#000080), white, and light grays, with USMC Scarlet (#CC0000) and Gold (#FFC300) as accent colors to highlight important elements or calls-to-action.
